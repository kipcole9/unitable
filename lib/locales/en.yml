            definition: |
                The fundamental unit of length in the metric system, 
                equal to 100 centimetres or approximately 39.37 inches. Originally 
                intended to be one ten-millionth of the distance from the Earth's 
                equator to the North Pole (at sea level), its definition has 
                been periodically refined to reflect growing knowledge of metrology. 
                Since 1983, it has been defined as "the length of the path travelled 
                by light in vacuum during a time interval of 1/299,792,458 of a second

            definition: |
                A unit of distance used in astronomy, equal to about 3.26 light years (3.086 × 1013 kilometres). 
                One parsec corresponds to the distance at which the mean radius of the earth's orbit subtends an 
                angle of one second of arc.
